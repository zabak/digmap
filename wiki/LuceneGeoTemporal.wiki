= Introduction =

 * Provides a very simple and efective Abstraction Top Layer on Lucene
 * Provide a collection of Extensions and Wrappers to main classes like IndexWriter, IndexSearcher, Document, Query
 * Provide integrated geographical, time and textual search services using local lucene and Sorting in two diferente models (Vector Space Model and Language Model)
 * Provide QE expansion using LucQE
 * Provide a framework to process collections in search topics returning output in TRECEVAL tool format
 * Provide an example using Braun Corpus and 7 runs with the configuration submited to TEL@CLEF 2008 Mono-language Adhoc task

= Libraries =

Patching and gluing together the following libraries:

 * Lucene http://lucene.apache.org
 * Local lucene http://sourceforge.net/projects/locallucene
 * LucQE
 * Lucene SandBox
 * IPLS Lucene with Language Modeling

= Using LGTE =

We provide a set of unit tests to help you to learn how to use LGTE. Our Library it is very similar to Lucene
and gives you an abstraction layer of time and spatial. You can find our examples at pt.utl.ist.lucene.test

Start with classes prefixed with SIMPLE. The other classes are also simple but there you will found more complex
tests. After the simple try TestSpatialDistanceWithLgteQueryParser and TestSpatialDistanceWithLgte.

In our spatial examples we use a set of bars and restaurants in Portalegre, Portugal.
We set the stadium as the start geoPoint. you can find a Google Earth Document KML with this information.
If you check the distances with Google Earth you will see that the results are correct.

= TREC/CLEF Evaluation Framework =

We provide a tool to index a collection, run a set of search topics and output the results in treckeval format. This format is like a standard in information retrieval tasks. You can found i in package pt.utl.ist.lucene.treceval

We provide a test collection and a geospatial collection as an example and we configure those collections with a set of runs previously used in old tasks.

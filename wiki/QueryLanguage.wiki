= Lgte Query Language =

This page is a quick tour on how to use LGTE query language. Follow we describe the fields carried by LGTE and their possible values.

= Fields =

LGTE provides a top layer on lucene query parser creating an `LgteQuery`. `LgteQueryParser` parses a query on LGTE query language creating a middle query we call a level 1 query. This query will have all LGTE specific parameters in `QueryParams` class and the rest of the query will be parsed with lucene `QueryParser`. You can crete an `LgteQuery` by yourself passing a `Query` and a `QueryParams`, or you can simply use our query language and let `LgteQueryParser` do the job for you. Next list enumerates all possible fields of LGTE query language, each of the with parameter in `QueryParam`:

 * lat (query reference latitude)
 * lng (query reference longitude)
 * north (limited box north limit)
 * south (limited box south limit)
 * east (limited box east limit)
 * west (limited box west limit)
 * radium (limit radium in miles by default)
 * radiumMiles
 * radiumKm
 * starttime (Time interval query bottom limit yyyy[-mm[-dd]] or reverse direction)
 * endtime (Top limit in time)
 * starttimeMiliseconds (in miliseconds)
 * endtimeMiliseconds (in miliseconds)
 * time (Reference Query Time yyyy[-mm[-dd]] or reverse direction)
 * timeMiliseconds (in miliseconds)
 * radiumYears (limit radium in years)
 * radiumMonths 
 * radiumDays 
 * radiumHours 
 * radiumMinutes
 * radiumSeconds
 * radiumMiliSeconds
 * order
 * filter
 * qe
 * model

You can combine all this fields creating your query. You just need to know the constraints in terms of minimal queries:

 * `SpatialPointQuery(lat,lng)`
 * `SpatialPointQuery(lat,lng,SRadium)` where `SRadium := radium | radiumMiles | radiumKm
 * `SpatialRectangleQuery(north,south,east,west)` where `north, south := latitude; west, east := longitude`
  * `Point` can be defined by your self with a simple `SpatialPointQuery` or LGTE will set the middle point in rectangle
 * `TimePointQuery(time)`
 * `TimePointQuery(time,TRadium)` where `TRadium := radiumYears | radiumMonths | ... | radiumMiliSeconds`
 * `IntervalQuery(startTime, endTime)`
  * You can define a `TimePointQuery` to set reference query point or you can let LGTE choose the middle point between start and end time

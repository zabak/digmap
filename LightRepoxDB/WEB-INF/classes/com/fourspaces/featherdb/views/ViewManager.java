/**
 * 
 * View urls are in the form of: /db/_view/viewname
 * 
 * View results are generated for each document when it is updated.
 * The main engine is notified about the update and the engine notifies the ViewManager.
 * 
 * The view manager then processes the document through all the views for the enclosing database.
 * If the view returns a result, that result is appended to the cached results file for that view.
 * 
 * Oh yeah, there is a cached results file for all views.
 * 
 * There is also an index for all views that contains two things:
 * 1) a sorted list of keys
 * 2) the position in the cached results file where the cached data is located.
 * 
 * This allows for appending of data to the cached results file, while only having to re-sort the index.
 * This is a much lighter weight operation.  The newly sorted index is only written if there are no pending
 * requests... basically, requests for results will place a Lock on the View.  The cached results can be optimized
 * for sequential access, but this isn't required.  
 *
 * Views can be handled by anything that implements the View interface.  This includes javascript
 * CouchDB style views.  If the "type" of view is 'text/javascript', then the javascript handler is used.
 * Otherwise, the 'type' is assumed to be a fully-qualified class name.

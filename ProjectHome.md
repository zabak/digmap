DIGMAP  stands  for  Discovering  our  Past  World  with  Digitized  Historical  Maps, but  it  could  stand  also  for  Digging  on  Maps!

It was a EU-funded project that addressed the development of a  portal  and  a  set  of  central  services  for  discovering  old  maps  from  European  libraries  and  other  relevant  providers  (including  collections  with  descriptions  available  through  OAI‐PMH).

This repository collects the open source software, and patches to existing open source tools, developed as part of the project.
